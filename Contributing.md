# Contributing to 50-Startups-Profit-Analysis-and-Predictive-Modelling

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project!  
This open-source project focuses on analysing startup expenditures (R&D, Administration, Marketing, and State) using the classic ‚Äú50 Startups‚Äù dataset and building predictive models for profit. Your contributions, big or small, are warmly welcome.



## üèÜ How You Can Contribute

- **Data Enhancements**: Add more datasets, extend historical data, refine cleaning and preprocessing.  
- **Model Development**: Introduce additional predictive modelling techniques (e.g., Ridge, Lasso, Decision Tree, Random Forest), compare outcomes, improve metrics.  
- **Visualisations**: Create compelling charts, dashboards or interactive visuals to better illustrate relationships and model results.  
- **Documentation**: Improve clarity in README, add walkthroughs, usage examples, dataset descriptions, and how-to guides.  
- **Bug Fixes & Optimisations**: Fix any code issues, streamline model performance, ensure reproducibility, clean up notebooks.
