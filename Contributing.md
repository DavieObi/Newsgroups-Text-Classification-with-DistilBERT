# Contributing to Newsgroups-Text-Classification-with-DistilBERT

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project!  
This open-source repository is focused on text classification of the 20 Newsgroups dataset using the DistilBERT transformer model. Whether you are an NLP enthusiast, a data scientist, or simply curious, your contributions are very welcome.



## üèÜ How You Can Contribute

- **Data Enhancements**: Add further preprocessing pipelines, include additional datasets or refine existing cleaning methods.  
- **Model Improvements**: Experiment with different transformer architectures, hyperparameter tuning, ensemble methods or performance benchmarking.  
- **Visualization & Analysis**: Create new plots, confusion matrices, classification reports, or interactive dashboards to better illustrate model performance.  
- **Documentation**: Improve the README, add step-by-step guides, usage examples, tutorials or notebook walkthroughs.  
- **Testing & Validation**: Ensure reproducibility, add unit tests, document evaluation metrics clearly, or optimize for deployment.
